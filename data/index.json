    "about": [ 
        "My name is Jay-donn Hendricks, and I am an aspiring developer currently studying to become a junior developer in the tech industry. My journey began at the age of 7 when I first explored a computer. I was fascinated by its inner workings and the components it was made of, igniting my passion for technology. This fascination led me to start building my own computers at the age of 10.My love for coding grew during the times when I had to update software. Delving deeper into understanding software functionality changed my perception of how profoundly it influences the entire computer, from programs to games. Now, I am dedicated to pursuing my dreams, aiming to become the best version of myself. I aspire to create new technologies and software that will revolutionize the world as we know it, benefiting both myself and others."

I still want to learn more about them."
